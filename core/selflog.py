"""
core/selflog.py - the assistant's own record of what it printed.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    Everything LangVis knows about its own failures went to stdout. If it was
    launched from a terminal the traceback scrolled past; if it was launched by
    double-clicking, it went nowhere at all. Either way the one participant who
    could not see it was LangVis: the model heard "something went wrong" from
    the user and had nothing to look at.

    So a crash could happen twice in a row and the second time the assistant
    was as surprised as the first.

    This tees stdout and stderr - every print, every traceback - into two
    places: a real file on disk, and a ring buffer in memory the model can be
    handed on request. Nothing at the call sites changes; installing the tee is
    the whole integration.

WHY A RING BUFFER AND A FILE
    The buffer is what the model reads: bounded, instant, no disk seek in the
    middle of a conversation. The file is what survives a crash, so "what
    happened before it died" is still answerable after a restart.
